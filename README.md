# Measure Energy Comsumotion of each executable

Problem Statement: At present, there is no definite way to understand the energy consumption of each executable running on a machine, including the "kilowatt per hour", "CO2 emissions", "CPU temperature", "Fan Speed" etc.
These factors contribute to the heat generated by each CPU and eventually, affect the electricity consumption, cooling requirements, green-house gases and carbon footprint of our VM's.

## Appendix

Challenges to solve: 
- Understanding the metrics per program that contribute to the carbon footprint, energy consumption and green house effect
- Figuring out these metrics per executable for different processors, hardware topology, different GPU's, network topology etc.
- Meaningfully understanding and visualizing the green-house effect of the execution of a program on the environment.
 
Expected Impact:
Using this tool, each BU will be able to understand the energy, pollution and green house impact of execution of their application on the environment and accordingly make corresponding changes to reduce their carbon foorprint
